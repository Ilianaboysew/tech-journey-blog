My grandpa is one of my biggest inspirations. He has obtained this title due to him being an all around G. At 81 years old he drops an absolute atomic bomb of lore on the family. In this post I'm going to list the top 5 craziest pieces of lore he dropped within a 3 hour conversation.


1. He attended 7 different colleges including Stanford, University of Chicago, UNI, ISU, and Iowa University
2. His Dad was the Mayor of an Iowa city/town
3. He got attacked by monkey's because he had cherry pits in his pocket
4. He was a barber in San Fransisco- He's bald now though
5. He got 4th place in the D2 wrestling meet and 8th place in the D1 wrestling meet when he was in college
