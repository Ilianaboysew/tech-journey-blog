This day has been one of the longest ever. 
I've played solitare, 8 ball, wordle, connections, and basically every other nyt game but the time is still going too slow. Half of my friends have fallen (asleep).
I tried listening to the conversation but that is more boring than all the other stuff I was doing before. I do not think this is worth the 1000 dollars anymore.
